# Whistle Detection
This is a Java-based application designed to detect and count cooker whistles using audio input from a microphone. It utilizes Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze audio frequencies and identify whistle sounds within a specified frequency range.

FEATURES :-
- Real-time audio capture from the microphone.
- Detection of cooker whistles based on predefined frequency ranges.
- Count the number of whistles detected during the runtime of the application.
- Infinite listening capability until manually stopped.

Although this is a real-time project, the result might not be 100% accurate to detect all cooker whistles.
